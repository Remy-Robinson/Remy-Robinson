### 🧠 About Me

I'm a curious builder who enjoys mixing tech and creativity — whether it's prototyping with Arduino, working with machine learning, or building smart user interfaces.

Right now, I’m diving deeper into:
- Gesture-based interaction systems
- Arduino-powered embedded devices
- Full-stack development (React, Django, MongoDB)
- AI for real-time sensory processing
